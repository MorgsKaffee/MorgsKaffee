<p align="center">
Hi, I’m <strong>Morgana Albrecht</strong> from <strong>Switzerland 🇨🇭</strong>.<br>
I’m a 24-year-old Helvetic-Brazilian currently based in Switzerland, where I’m pursuing a degree in medicine with a strong interest in clinical research and biomedical innovation. Outside the academic environment, I actively engage in software development, with a focus on modding and simulation systems. My current project involves the development of a nuclear technology-themed addon for the Create mod, integrating advanced mechanical logic and custom systems within the Minecraft modding framework. Bridging healthcare and technology has become a central part of my identity, as I explore the intersection between scientific rigor and creative problem-solving.
